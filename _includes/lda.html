            <div class="large text-muted"> However, it's important to note that while Wikispeedia primarily focuses on categorizing entities, the topic distribution generated by our LDA model is more concerned with the actual content of the passages.<br>
                To give you an idea of how this works in practice, let’s consider the example of Édouard Manet, the famous French painter. In Wikispeedia, Manet would be classified under the category of "People.Artists". However, this classification tells us very little about the specific content of Manet's page or the themes and topics that it covers.

            <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto text-justify">
              <div class="large text-muted"> Our LDA model allowed us to delve into the actual content of Manet's page, where the most significant topic was "Art and literature." This suggests that Manet's page is heavily focused on topics related to the world of art and literature, such as his paintings, artistic style, and the cultural context in which he worked.

                <div class="large text-muted"> <br>Having obtained an understanding of the topic distribution of each article through the LDA model, we are now able to examine the changes in topics within the paths that users take during the game. 

                    <br>For instance, one user who was assigned the path from "People's Republic of China" to "Jesus" took the following route: "People's Republic of China" - "Giant's Causeway" - "Martin Luther King, Jr." - "Last Supper" - "Jesus." This path showed a clear trend of the proportion of religion-related topics increasing as the user progressed towards the destination. We draw the topic transition diagram and display it below. The y axis is the topic probability distribution of article that player choose. And the x axis is the article that player choose during the game.

                    We also select another finished path in the dataset. The user with the same start and destination took a different path: "People's Republic of China" - "Latin" - "Romulus Augustus" - "Christmas Island" - "Jesus." While this path also showed a similar trend of increasing religion-related topics, it took the user several more steps to reach the final destination.

                    Let’s take a look at all the paths from PRC to Jesus. It seems that we often see that the transition between the topics of "government affairs" and "religion" goes through intermediate topics such as "nature" or "urban construction." However, this can vary significantly between different users.                </div>

                    From the above analysis, we draw to the conclusion that thought we might expect the distribution of topics within the links that users click on to follow a linear or summable path, this is not always the case in practice. Instead, the overall trend of topic distribution within the paths that users choose tends to evolve towards the target, but due to differences in prior knowledge and the unknown nature of the chosen links, it is difficult to develop a comprehensive method for fully capturing the users' thought processes.            </div>
