    desc: "Navigation in the information network is an essential part of our everyday lives. It is significant to understand how humans build the link between two words, in order to design user-friendly interactive system. <br>
    
    It is a general idea that: different from how a computer process the task, humans will not always choose the shortest path to reach destination. And at the first glance, one might consider that different people will link two words in various way according to their prior knowledge. <br>
    
    However, here we want to investigate whether there is a common and general pattern in human’s formation of the word navigating. During the way-finding procedure, do human generate fantastic ideas to finish the word to word linking? Or though people finish the task in various path, there still exist a potential pattern in human’s mind to link two topic words. <br>
    
    We carry out our analysis by using the dataset collecting through the human-computation game <strong>Wikispeedia</strong>. "
    
    desc_2: "Our main approach consists in analyzing the finished path during the game and delving into the contents in HTML pages which people scan in their navigation actions. 
    
    The analysis part could be divided into two primary sections: research on the potential pattern included in the finished path (internal factor) and study whether the contents in HTML pages will influence people’s way-finding between the source and destination (external factor)."

        desc: "Is there any specific pattern change in articles' topic component, during the clicking process? For example, when navigating from ‘Zebra’ to ‘French Revolution’, there is a hypothesis that the elements of animals may decrease, and the elements of history or politics would increase through the path. Does the ‘Zebra & French Revolution‘ hypothesis mentioned above or similar phenomenon hold?"

        desc: "Are there any external factors that influence people’s choice of clicking, i.e. contents on HTML pages? <br>
        1. Do people tend to click links in an easy sentence or a professional sentence? <br>
        2. Do people tend to click links that show up in the first a few lines of the article or links that have concentrated distribution in the webpage?"

    title_0: "Let's take an overview of our datasets"

    body_1_0: "
      Wikipedia is a collaborative online encyclopedia that contains articles on a wide range of topics. The articles are written and edited by volunteers, and are organized into categories to help readers find related information."
    title_1: "Basic Analysis on the common pattern of navigation paths"
    q_1: "**What path do people like to follow? Which category of articles do people tend to select?**"
    a_1: "We begin our investigation by counting the basic statistical results from the dataset. We focus on the finished path and try to find whether there is an article selection tendency in people’s playing procedure. The section will be divided into two parts. In the first part, we will investigate which kind of article do people select in their first step. In the second part, we study on the finished path in details. We introduce the term **path pair** and carry out the statistical analysis on which path pair do people often choose."
    q_2: "**Which kind of articles do people select in their first step?**"
    a_2: "In the dataset, each article has its own belonging category, and the category is in hierarchical form with the deepest depth reaches 3rd layer. For example, the word **Albatross** belongs to category “subject.Science.Biology.Birds”. 
    
    For simplicity, we only use the second layer as their category in our analysis. Therefore, there are 15 article categories in total in the dataset. When it comes to the finished path, we remove the path with the length equals to 0 which means that the source and the destination words is the same or the destination word directly shows in the source article. 
    
    In this situation, it is hard for us to distinguish whether the player finish the navigation tasks by lucky or not.<br>
    After the pre-processing above, we count all the category of the first article that people choose. The result is shown as below:"
    a_3: "Besides counting the number of clicking on the first articles, we also include the number of articles in each category in the picture. We consider that the article number in one category will also influence people’s clicking behavior and the normalization is necessary. For example, the clicking on articles belongs to Science is 13672 times while the amount of articles in this category is also large (1122 articles). As a consequence, we calculate the ratio of each category and draw the statistical diagram again."
    a_4: "From the above results, we draw to the conclusion that people tend to select articles belong to category **Countries** and **Geography** in their first step. The ratio is far larger than the other categories. We speculate the reason is that people are more familiar with the **Countries** and **Geography** information of the target words. It is a general approach of getting closer to the destination via moving to articles that have similar geographic location and country information. Take the word “panda” for instance. When people are required to navigate to this target, people should first click to articles that include China or Asia elements. Hence, the **Countries** and **Geography** information could help people step closer to their target quickly which leads to the high ratio results of category **Countries** and **Geography** in the above diagram. And this is a possible linking pattern exist in the game."
    
    q_3: "**Which path pair occurs the highest times in all paths?**"
    a_5: "Then, we count the number of path pair in the finished path. We will first give the definition of path pair. Assuming there is a finished path A->B->C->D, then the path pair of it is (A,B), (B,C) and (C,D). Considering that the last three path pairs will be influenced by the distribution of target word in all games significantly, we will remove the last three path pairs. The result is shown below:"
    a_6: "From the above results, we find that the path pair (Brain, Computer_science), (Asteroid, Earth), (North_America, United_States), (Europe, United_Kingdom) and (United_States, North_America) are the top 5 path pairs that occur. Most of these five path pairs include the information of geography and countries. It seems that this result strengthened our conclusion in the first part of this section: People tends to use the geographic location and nationality to find the target words. <br>
          Then, take the path pair (North_America, United_States) for example. We would like to find in which source and target categories do people tend to generate this path pair. The outcome is as following:"
    a_7: "From the result, we find that the path pair (North_America, United_States) always appear when the categories of the source and destination words are about science, geography and people. And people also click the United States in the North America article when the destination word belongs to IT and Technology. We consider that the selection of the article to click next is significantly impacted by the category of source and target words, however, when the category is not related to the path pair, people also click the article United States. It might could be explained by the contents that people scan during the game.<br>
          In the later analysis, we will delve deeper into the influence of HTML page towards to the frequency of path pair. In more detail, we will discuss whether the HTML contents lead to the high occurrence frequency of path pair (North_America, United_States). Does the readability lead to the result above?"
